 * ************************************************************
 * Description:
 * Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
 * For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the root.
 * For example:
 * Given the below binary tree,
 * 1
 * / \
 * 2   3
 * Return 6.
