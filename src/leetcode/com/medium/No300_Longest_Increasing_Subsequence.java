 * ****************************************************************
 * Description:
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
 * The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4.
 * Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
 * <p>
 * Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
 * <p>
 * Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
